# Single-Transistor Amplifier Design ðŸ”Š

Welcome to the Single-Transistor Amplifier project! This project focuses on designing, simulating, and building a transistor-based amplifier that maintains good linearity and low signal attenuation. The amplifier must deliver a Â±0.5V input signal to a 100Î© load, using only **one transistor** and no op-amps.

---

## Project Objective

Design an amplifier that:
- Accepts an input of **Â±0.5V** through a **100Î© source resistance**.
- Delivers the signal to a **100Î© load**.
- Ensures **less than 10% attenuation**.
- Achieves **good linearity** across the full input range.

---

## Constraints

- Must use **only one transistor** (MOSFET or BJT).
- **No op-amps** are allowed.
- Powered only by **available DC supplies** from the Digilent module.
- Signal must be demonstrated with different **waveforms and amplitudes** up to 0.5V.
- Series 100Î© resistor must be included at the input.

## Technologies & Tools Used

- **LTspice** or equivalent: For circuit simulation and gain verification.
- **Analog Discovery 3 (AD3)**: Function generator and oscilloscope.
- **Breadboard and discrete components**: For physical implementation.
- **NPN BJT or nMOS transistor**: Selected based on desired gain and biasing requirements.
